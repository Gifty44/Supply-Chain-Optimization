# Geospatial Supply Chain Optimization

## Project Background

Efficient logistics performance is a critical factor in supply chain management, impacting cost, delivery speed, and customer satisfaction. This project aims to analyze logistics performance data using advanced data analytics techniques. The objective is to optimize shipping routes, minimize delivery delays, and enhance overall supply chain efficiency using data-driven insights.


## Data Structure

The dataset used in this analysis consists of the following:

* Order Details: Shipment ID, Order Date, Delivery Date, Factory of Origin

* Route Information: Source, Destination, Distance, and Route Optimization Score

* Performance Metrics: On-time delivery rate, average delay per factory, shipping route efficiency

* Geospatial Data: Shipping routes mapped to global locations

Executive Summary

The logistics performance dashboard presents a comprehensive view of key operational metrics. The geospatial shipping route map visualizes global trade routes, helping to identify potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies. The on-time delivery chart shows a stable but slightly fluctuating performance over the months. Factory delay analysis highlights varying delay levels across different factories. The route optimization pie chart indicates that 96.1% of shipments are on time, with only 3.9% delayed. These insights drive the optimization of logistics strategies to enhance overall performance.
