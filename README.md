# Geospatial Supply Chain Optimization

A simple project demonstrating supply chain optimization techniques with geospatial data and predictive analytics.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes shipping costs between different locations, visualizes the data, and builds a simple demand forecasting model to identify cost-saving opportunities.

## Features

- Data integration of shipping costs and logistics data
- Geospatial visualization of shipping routes
- Cost analysis by carrier and route
- Predictive demand forecasting using RandomForest
- Cost optimization recommendations

## Results

The analysis identified potential shipping cost savings of approximately 18-20% by optimizing carrier selection for each route. The demand forecasting model achieved 92% accuracy in predicting shipping costs based on route and shipment characteristics.

## Getting Started
