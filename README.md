# Geospatial Supply Chain Optimization

## Project Background

Efficient logistics performance is a critical factor in supply chain management, impacting cost, delivery speed, and customer satisfaction. This project aims to analyze logistics performance data using advanced data analytics techniques. The objective is to optimize shipping routes, minimize delivery delays, and enhance overall supply chain efficiency using data-driven insights.


## Data Structure

The dataset used in this analysis consists of the following:

* Order Details: Shipment ID, Order Date, Delivery Date, Factory of Origin

* Route Information: Source, Destination, Distance, and Route Optimization Score

* Performance Metrics: On-time delivery rate, average delay per factory, shipping route efficiency

* Geospatial Data: Shipping routes mapped to global locations
  

## Executive Summary

The logistics performance dashboard presents a comprehensive view of key operational metrics. The geospatial shipping route map visualizes global trade routes, helping to identify potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies. The on-time delivery chart shows a stable but slightly fluctuating performance over the months. Factory delay analysis highlights varying delay levels across different factories. The route optimization pie chart indicates that 96.1% of shipments are on time, with only 3.9% delayed. These insights drive the optimization of logistics strategies to enhance overall performance.

## Insight Deep Dive

### Geospatial Logistics Analysis

* The shipping route map reveals major trade paths and highlights potential inefficiencies.

* Key trade hubs are identified, allowing for improved distribution network planning.

* The analysis provides insights into distance optimization, ensuring cost-effective logistics solutions.

### On-Time Delivery Trends

* Historical data shows minor fluctuations in delivery performance across months.

* The average on-time delivery rate remains stable, suggesting effective management but potential areas for improvement.

* Seasonal trends could be influencing performance, requiring further analysis.

### Factory Delay Analysis

* Delays vary across different factories, indicating location-specific challenges.

* Factory C has the highest average delay, signaling potential operational bottlenecks.

* Optimization strategies could involve resource allocation adjustments or workflow improvements.

### Route Optimization

* The 96.1% on-time delivery rate suggests effective route planning.

* The 3.9% delay rate may be due to traffic congestion, customs processing, or weather disruptions.

* Advanced machine learning models could predict delays and propose alternative routes in real-time.

## Skills & Technologies Used

* SQL: Extracted and processed large datasets from relational databases to track logistics KPIs.

* Power BI & Tableau: Created interactive dashboards visualizing shipping routes, delivery performance, and factory delays.

* Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn): Utilized for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling for logistics efficiency.

* Machine Learning & Forecasting: Built predictive models to estimate delivery delays and optimize shipment routes.


## Recommendations
